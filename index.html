        Hello how are you whats up

        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a 
        type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable 
            content of a page when looking at its layout. 
        </p>
        <p>
            point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of 
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
            sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, 
            sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
                2000 years old.

                Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, 
                looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum 
                passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,  
                comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" 
                (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a 
                treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The 
                first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line 
                in section 1.10.32 discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum.
